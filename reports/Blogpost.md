# Prediction of Drought Levels

## Introduction
In the last years, climate change has become a more popular topic in the worldwide news. It affects our lives in multiple areas. One popular effect that it has is global warming. It is the effect that, due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, the average temperature will rise in the lower levels of the atmosphere. (Zitat Wikipedia)
With the rise of the average temperature drought periods will happen more often. This is especially problematic for countries whose average temperature is already higher than the average temperature in Germany.
The effect is particularly bad for agriculture.
The weather forecast is often only accurate for the next few days. What if there was a method to predict the rough drought level for a longer timespan? This is where our project comes into play.
## Dataset
We used a Dataset from Kaggle.com which contained weather data from the US from the years 2000 until 2020. In the dataset, the feature variable was a score ranging from 0 (no drought) to 5 (D4). D4 is the highest level of drought. There are six levels of drought possible. (Bild einf√ºgen) This dataset was constructed with data from the US Drought Monitor and the NASA POWER Project. 
The U.S. Drought Monitor is a map released every Thursday, showing parts of the U.S. that are in drought. The map uses five classifications: 
abnormally dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought: moderate (D1), severe (D2), 
extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4). The NASA POWER Project provides solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.
